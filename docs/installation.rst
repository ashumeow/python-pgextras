**Dependencies**

* psycopg2: python-pgextras will not install this for you. I do not feel comfortable
  forcing a specific version of your database driver module. If you come across a
  bug with your version of psycopg2 please open an `issue <https://github.com/scottwoodall/python-pgextras/issues/new>`_.

At the command line::

    $ pip install pgextras
